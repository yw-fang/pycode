Introduction
################

This repo. is just my playground to package the python code.

To install this repo., please firstly clone it,
and then install it by 'pip install .' or 'python setup.py
install' or 'pip install pyplayground'

I published this code on test-PyPI, but not on PyPI, hence we can
also install this code by
"pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyplayground"

.. You cannot install this repo. py 'pip install pyplayground' because
  I do not register and publish it on PyPI.

Dependencies
################

You do not need install the following codes by yourselves,
when installing this pyplayground, these will be installed or updated
automatically in your python environment.
